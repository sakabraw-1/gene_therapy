## ✅ Your Questions - Answered

### 1️⃣ How to Add/Update/Delete Images in the Future?

**Answer**: You have **2 easy methods** - no coding required!

📖 **Complete Guide**: [HOW_TO_MANAGE_PHOTOS.md](docs/HOW_TO_MANAGE_PHOTOS.md)

**Quick Summary**:
- **Add Photos**: Go to GitHub → `images` folder → Click "Upload files" → Name them `image 53.jpg`, `image 54.jpg`, etc.
- **Update Code**: Edit `js/script.js` → Add 2 lines per photo → Done!
- **Delete Photos**: Click image in GitHub → Click trash icon → Remove from code
- **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

### 2️⃣ How Do Events Work? Do They Auto-Show?

**Answer**: Yes! Events appear automatically when you add them to the homepage.

📖 **Complete Guide**: [EVENT_MANAGEMENT_FOR_PARENTS.md](docs/EVENT_MANAGEMENT_FOR_PARENTS.md)

**How It Works**:
- ✅ Edit `index.html` → Update event date/time/details → Commit changes
- ✅ Event appears on homepage immediately
- ✅ Registrations come to your email (via Netlify)
- ✅ View all registrations in Netlify dashboard anytime
- ✅ Export to Excel/CSV with one click
- **Time Required**: 20-30 minutes to update

### 3️⃣ Do Finished Events Auto-Archive?

**Answer**: Not automatic YET, but easy to manage manually (or I can make it automatic).

**Current Process**:
- After event date passes, you edit `index.html` to update to next event
- OR create a "Past Events" section (I can build this for you!)
- **Time Required**: 15 minutes per update

**Want Automatic?** I can add JavaScript that:
- Checks event date
- Hides events that are past
- Shows "No upcoming events" message
- Takes 1-2 hours to implement - let me know!

### 4️⃣ Can I Use This for Different Fundraising Goals?

**Answer**: Absolutely! Super easy to update.

📖 **Complete Guide**: [FUNDRAISING_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/FUNDRAISING_MANAGEMENT.md)

**How to Change Goal**:
1. Edit `js/script.js` → Line 3-6
2. Change `GOAL_AMOUNT = 5000000` (for new $5M goal)
3. Change `TRIAL_DATE` to new deadline
4. Update homepage text to describe new campaign
5. Commit changes → Done!
6. **Time Required**: 10 minutes

**Example Use Cases**:
- New clinical trial phase
- Equipment fundraising
- Awareness campaign
- Annual recurring fundraiser

### 5️⃣ What If Goal Isn't Reached on Time?

**Answer**: You have **4 easy options** - all explained in detail!

📖 **Complete Guide**: [FUNDRAISING_MANAGEMENT.md - Section: What If You Don't Reach Goal](docs/FUNDRAISING_MANAGEMENT.md#what-if-you-dont-reach-goal-on-time)

**Options**:
1. **Extend Deadline**: Just change the date in `script.js` (5 minutes)
2. **Adjust Goal**: Lower the target to realistic amount (10 minutes)
3. **Multi-Phase**: Break into phases (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ongoing)
4. **New Campaign**: Start fresh campaign, archive old one

**All options maintain transparency and donor trust!**

### 6️⃣ How Do Non-Technical Parents Manage This?

**Answer**: I created a **complete step-by-step guide** specifically for parents with ZERO coding experience!

📖 **START HERE**: [COMPLETE_PARENT_GUIDE.md](docs/COMPLETE_PARENT_GUIDE.md)

- ✅ Weekly tasks - 30 minutes  
- ✅ Monthly tasks - 2 hours

Pair experienced parent with new one:
