## üéØ Common Questions

### "What if I break something?"

**You can't really break it!** GitHub saves every version. You can always:
- Revert to a previous version
- Ask tech volunteer to fix it
- Start over if needed

### "How much time will this take?"

**Realistically:**
- Daily: 5 minutes (checking emails)
- Weekly: 30 minutes (updates)
- Monthly: 2 hours (content creation)
- **Total: ~3 hours/month**

### "Do I need to know coding?"

**No!** You're just:
- Typing text (like in Microsoft Word)
- Uploading photos (like on Facebook)
- Clicking buttons (like any website)

The "code" is just text in a file. You're editing the words, not writing new code.

### "What if I don't have time?"

**Solutions:**
1. Share responsibilities with other parents
2. Hire a virtual assistant (even part-time)
3. Recruit tech-savvy volunteers from community
4. Set up monthly "website update parties" with other parents

### "Can I hire someone to do this?"

**Yes!** You can:
- Hire a freelancer on Upwork/Fiverr ($10-30/hour)
- Ask college student to volunteer
- Partner with local coding bootcamp for volunteer help
- Budget $100-300/month for ongoing management

### "What if technology isn't my thing?"

**That's okay!** Consider:
1. **Find a parent who's better with tech** - Many families want to help!
2. **Watch video tutorials** - Easier than reading guides
3. **Start with just one task** - Master one thing at a time
4. **Ask for help** - CDKL5 community is supportive
5. **Use simpler alternatives** - Some platforms are more user-friendly
