We are developing the groundbreaking CDKL5 AAV9 gene replacement therapy – the much needed, and awaited for CDKL5 Disorder (also known as CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder - CDD).  

Learn everything about this historic parent-led program and how you can help us reach our $3.5 million goal to bring this phase I/II gene therapy to CDKL5 patients worldwide.

What is the CDKL5 Gene Therapy? 

Gene therapy is a cutting-edge approach that targets the root cause of genetic disorders by replacing or correcting a faulty gene.  

In CDKL5 Disorder,  a single gene mutation disrupts brain development and function. Our gene replacement therapy aims to restore healthy CDKL5 expression by delivering a working copy of the gene directly to brain cells. 

To do this, we use an AAV9 viral vector—a trusted and widely used delivery system for gene therapy in the brain. Think of the vector as a boat, carrying the healthy CDKL5 gene (the passenger) to the cells that need it. Once delivered, the goal is to replace the loss of CDKL5 protein caused by the mutation, helping the cells function more normally. 

Why Is Gene Therapy So Promising? 

Gene therapy has transformed what once seemed impossible into reality: the ability to treat, and in some cases reverse, devastating genetic diseases with a single treatment. In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)—a disease that was once universally fatal in infants—gene therapy (Zolgensma®) has enabled babies to sit, stand, and even walk. In Leber congenital amaurosis, a form of inherited blindness, gene therapy (Luxturna®) has restored vision in children. And in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), gene therapy has halted disease progression and preserved neurological function in young patients who would otherwise have faced severe decline. 

While every disorder is unique, these breakthroughs show the extraordinary potential of gene therapy to change lives—not just manage symptoms, but rewrite the course of disease. 

 

Why Gene Therapy is a Promising Approach for CDKL5 Disorder 

CDKL5 Disorder is caused by a mutation in just one copy of the CDKL5 gene. That means the body still has one working copy - it simply needs more of the correct CDKL5 protein. Gene therapy is uniquely suited to this type of disorder because it can deliver a working copy of the gene directly to the brain, increasing CDKL5 protein levels and improving key neurological functions. Current scientific data and preclinical models give us real reason to believe that gene therapy can make a meaningful difference in the lives of children with CDKL5 disorder. That’s why we’re moving urgently—and carefully—toward and through clinical trials. 

Our preclinical data shows that this technique works using various types of AAV vectors (boats) in animal models of CDKL5 syndrome, where we observe treatment-induced increase in expression of CDKL5 in animals’ brains, and in the downstream phosphorylation targets of the CDKL5 protein, and correspondingly we observe improvement in symptoms in the animals models, which recapitulate some of the symptoms characteristic of human CDKL5 Disorder patients.
